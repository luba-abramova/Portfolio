# Power BI Dashboard

I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize the survey results. Each component on the dashboard functions as a filter for the entire page. Since I am unable to publish the dashboard itself, I have included a screenshot for reference.

Key insights from the dashboard:
1) **Demographics**: there were more male respondents than female respondents, and more career switchers than non-switchers.
2) **Job Satisfaction**: male respondents reported higher satisfaction with work/life balance but lower satisfaction with salary compared to female respondents.
3) **Salary Comparisons**:
- Career switcher Data Scientists earn 29% more than non-switchers.
- Career switcher Data Architects earn 50% less than non-switchers.
4) **Gender Pay Gap**:
- Female Data Architects earn 76% less than their male counterparts.
- Female Database Developers earn 46% more than their male counterparts.
5) **Programming Languages**: the top three languages for data professionals are Python (66% of respondents), R (16%), and SQL (8%).
