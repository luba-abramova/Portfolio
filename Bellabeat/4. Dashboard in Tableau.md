# Dashboard in Tableau
Finally, I created an interactive visualization and prepared key findings based on the analysis.

## Key findings
### User groups

We identified 3 user groups: 
* Passive users: 2 users out of 35, 6% of total. On average, they use the tracker for 8.5 days out of 62.
* Moderate users: 30 users out of 35, 86% of total. On average, they use the tracker for 40 days out of 62.
* Active: 3 users out of 35, 9% of total. On average, they use the tracker for 53 days out of 62.

### Physical activity trends
* Passive users: exhibit peak activity on Tuesdays and lowest activity on Saturdays, predominantly engaging in morning activities.

* Moderate users: show heightened activity levels on Saturdays with a decline on Sundays. Activity is distributed evenly throughout the week, with a slight increase during evening hours.

* Active users: peak in activity on Mondays with a decrease on Tuesdays. Their activity is characterized by morning and evening peaks, suggesting engagement in pre- and post-work exercise routines.

Overall, participants display increased activity levels on Saturdays and decreased activity levels on Sundays, indicating a predominantly sedentary lifestyle during the week.

## Recommendations:

* **Obtain more data:** gather additional data from a larger user pool, incorporating more demographic information.

* **Engage passive users:** encourage passive users to transition to moderate activity levels by emphasizing the tracker's utility for tracking overall wellbeing, not just exercise.

* Conduct additional analysis investigate reasons behind **irregular tracker usage**, such as comfort, waterproofing, or design issues, through further analysis.

* **Promote active lifestyle:** encourage users to incorporate short exercises during weekdays and longer walks on weekends, particularly on Sundays, to foster a more active lifestyle. We don't want our users to feel anxious about walking less than 10000 steps per day. Instead, we can establish achievable weekly norms and implement a point-based system to motivate regular activity.
