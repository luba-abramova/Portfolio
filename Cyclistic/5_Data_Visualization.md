# Sharing findings. Data visualization in Power BI
In this section, I am sharing the key findings and insights from the analysis of the Cyclistic bike share data.

* For the year 2023, members accounted for 3,660,698 rides, which constituted 64% of the total rides. In contrast, casual riders contributed 2,059,179 rides, representing 36% of the total.

* In 2023, members showed a slight preference for electric bikes over classic, with 1,841,568 rides on electric bikes compared to 1,819,130 rides on classic bikes. Interestingly, members did not utilize docked bikes during this period. Casual riders, however, utilized all three bike types, with a preference for electric bikes: 1,104,011 rides were taken on electric bikes, followed by 876,881 rides on classic bikes, and 78,287 rides on docked bikes.

* In 2023, members exhibited peak travel times at 8 a.m., with a total of 244,217 rides, and at 5 p.m., with 387,975 rides. This suggests that members primarily used bicycles for commuting to and from work.
Conversely, casual users showed a gradual increase in travel throughout the day, with peak travel occurring at 5 p.m., totaling 199,281 rides. This indicates that casual riders prefer to use bicycles during their leisure time.

* Analysis of travel patterns throughout the week highlights distinct trends between members and casual riders. Members demonstrate higher usage on weekdays, likely for commuting and personal errands, whereas casual riders exhibit increased activity on weekends, indicative of recreational and leisurely usage, potentially including tourists.
The busiest day for members is Friday, with 589,586 rides, comprising 10.3% of the total, while the least busy day is Monday, with 408,856 rides, comprising 7.1% of the total. For casual riders, the busiest day is Sunday, with 410,706 rides, making up 7.2% of the total, while the least busy day is Tuesday, with 234,825 rides, constituting 4.1% of the total.

* Throughout the year, both groups exhibit an upward trend in usage during the summer months, which gradually declines as winter approaches. This seasonal pattern is attributed to favorable weather conditions for outdoor cycling. From May to September, casual riders account for 70% (1,439,534 out of 2,059,179) of trips, while members contribute 57% (2,059,179 out of 3,660,698) of trips, underscoring the seasonal nature of bicycle demand, particularly among casual riders.

* The average travel distance for both groups remains relatively consistent throughout the year. In June, members covered the longest distance, averaging 2247 meters per member per month, while casual riders also traveled the most in June, with an average of 2230 meters. Conversely, both groups traveled the shortest distance in January, with members averaging 1753 meters and casual riders averaging 1648 meters per month.

* Members exhibit a consistent average trip duration throughout the week, ranging from 11 to 14 minutes per day. In contrast, casual riders see an increase in trip duration on weekends to 32 minutes, dropping to 24 minutes on weekdays. This longer average ride duration among casual riders suggests potential leisurely usage, perhaps including sightseeing or slower-paced rides compared to members.

* In 2023, members maintained a relatively consistent average trip duration, with July recording the longest average trip duration of 14 minutes and January, February, and March registering the shortest at 10 minutes. Casual riders, however, showcased a more seasonal demand trend, with August witnessing the longest average rides of 35 minutes and November and December recording the shortest at 19 minutes.
