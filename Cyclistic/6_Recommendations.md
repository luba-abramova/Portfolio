Based on the analysis, I can conclude, that:

1.	Members accounted for the majority of rides in 2023, representing 64% of the total rides, while casual riders accounted for 36%.
2.	Electric bikes were preferred by both members and casual riders, with members slightly favoring them over classic bikes.
3.	Members primarily used bikes for commuting, with peak travel times at 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., while casual riders tended to ride during leisure hours, peaking at 5 p.m.

# Recommendations
1.	**Introduce the summer membership package** designed specifically for the summer season, featuring discounted rates and extra benefits for casual riders. Offer the opportunity to exupgrade this membership to annual later, providing incentives for long-term commitment. 
2.	**Consider running limited-time promotions** for annual memberships during peak riding periods to motivate more casual riders become members.
3. **Promote bike commuting**: highlight the benefits of bike commuting to work, such as cost savings, environmental sustainability, and improved health. Develop targeted marketing campaigns emphasizing how annual memberships facilitate daily commuting.
4. **Offer exclusive membership benefits**: elevate the membership experience by providing unique privileges like access to summer bike festivals, exclusive discounts at partner locations, and discounted rates for weekend rides. By offering additional value to members, such as exclusive events and savings opportunities, you can incentivize casual riders to transition to annual memberships and enhance their overall experience with Cyclistic.
