# Maximizing Annual Memberships for Cyclistic

 The project is based on the public [DIivvy dataset](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). Due to data-privacy issues riders’ personally identifiable information is unavailable.

 For this analysis, I will use MS Excel as a spreadsheet tool, SQL and MS SQL Server for queries, and Power BI for visualizations. 

## Scenario
I am a data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

## Goal
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members, thus maximizing the number of profitable annual members in the Cyclistic program.

## Data Overview
I use 2023 historical trip data (January 2023 – December 2023), consisting of 12 CSV files with 13 columns in each. The data includes ride ids, bike types, start and end dates and times, start and end station names, ids and coordinates, and rider’s type: member or casual.

The total number of rows in all 12 spreadsheets is 5,719,877. To combine these tables into one and to perform analysis, I will use MS SQL and SQL. Data cleaning will be performed in Excel.
