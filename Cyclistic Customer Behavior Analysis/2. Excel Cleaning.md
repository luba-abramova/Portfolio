# Data processing (Excel)

For further analyses, I created two new columns:
1.	**ride_length**: the length of each ride calculated by subtracting the column started_at from the column ended_at, formated as HH:MM:SS. Repeated for 12 files;

2.	**day_of_week**: the day of the week that each ride started, calculated using the WEEKDAY command in each file. Formated as a number with no decimals, noting that 1 = Sunday and 7 = Saturday.

# Data cleaning (Excel)

1.	Some entries in the ride_length column displayed an error message: “Dates and times are negative or too large”. Upon investigation, I observed that the start date in these entries preceded the end date, causing the issue. To rectify this, I utilized macros to replace the data in these fields.

2.	Certain entries in the latitude and longitude fields were formatted as text with apostrophes, potentially leading to import and conversion errors. To address this issue, I corrected the formatting.

3.	No duplicates were found in MS Excel.
 
4.	Upon inspection, I noticed some missing values in the start and end stations data. To address these, we will utilize SQL for further analysis in subsequent stages.

5.	For correct import of csv files to MS SQL Studio for further exploration changed formats for each column, for appropriate text, number, date formats. Saved all new files as CSV.
