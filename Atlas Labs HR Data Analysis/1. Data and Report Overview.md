## Overview

In this project, I created a Power BI dashboard to track HR analytics and understand the factors impacting attrition at Atlas Labs, a fictitious software company. The goal was to provide insights into employee demographics, attrition rates, and performance, enabling the HR team to make data-driven decisions.

The data covers the years 2012-2022 and consists of five CSV files: EducationLevel, Employee, PerformanceRating, RatingLevel, SatisfiedLevel. 

The final report (dashboart) contains four pages: 
* **Overivew:** Displays the company's key metrics, including the total number of employees, the number of active and inactive employees, and the attrition rate. It also features visualizations representing hiring trends over time and active employees by departments and job titles.
* **Demographics:** Focuses on diversity and inclusion, providing an overview of employees' age, gender, ethnicity, and marital status data.
* **Performance Tracker:** Helps understand employee performance, including past and upcoming review dates.
* **Attrition:** Shows attrition rates by department, hire date, tenure, travel frequency, and overtime requirements.

## Data Model

After importing the datasets into Power BI, I created a data model to establish relationships between the different tables and ensure the data could be effectively analyzed and visualized. Below is the screenshot of the data model:

## Measures

As part of my analysis, I created a new table named "_Measures" to store all the DAX measures required for the report. Specific DAX formulas associated with each section of the report are detailed below.

The final "_Measures" table, containing these and other DAX measures looks like that:

## Exploratory analysis

To start with, I explored the availabe data and calculated the key metrics to use them throughout the analysis. DAX measures I created:

```
TotalEmployees = COUNT(DimEmployee[EmployeeID])
```
```
ActiveEmployees = CALCULATE([TotalEmployees], DimEmployee[Attrition] = "No")
```
```
InactiveEmployees = CALCULATE([TotalEmployees], DimEmployee[Attrition] = "Yes")
```
```
%AttritionRate = [InactiveEmployees]/[TotalEmployees]
```

Next, I created a stacked column chart to visualize the company's hiring trends over time, allowing us to see the periods of biggest growth in new employees.

After that, I created a bar chart to show the distribution of employees by departments and a treemap to illustrate the distribution of job titles.

## Demographics
 After having a good understanding of the general hiring trends, I focused on analyzing the demographics of the employees. The demographics analysis involved creating visualizations and metrics to provide insights into the age, gender, marital status, and ethnicity of the workforce, such as:

* Two cards that display the minimum and maximum values for age;
* Age bins by adding a conditional column in PowerQuery;

* various charts shown below.

## Performance Tracker

The Performance Tracker page provides a comprehensive view of individual employee performance scores based on their annual reviews. The goal is to facilitate easy tracking and analysis of performance over time. The analysis includes:

* FullName column, created in PowerQuery (FullName = [FirstName] & “ “ & [LastName]);
* Slicer for employee selection;
* Last and next review dates, created with DAX:
```
LastReviewDate = 
IF(MAX(FactPerformanceRating[ReviewDate]) = BLANK(),
    "No Review Yet",
    MAX(FactPerformanceRating[ReviewDate])
)
```
```
NextReviewDate = VAR reviewOrHire =
    IF(
        MAX(FactPerformanceRating[ReviewDate]) = BLANK(),
        MAX(DimEmployee[HireDate]),
        MAX(FactPerformanceRating[ReviewDate])
    )
    RETURN reviewOrHire + 365
```

* Satisfaction measures, created with DAX:
```
WorkLifeBalance = 
CALCULATE(
    MAX(FactPerformanceRating[WorkLifeBalance]),
    USERELATIONSHIP(FactPerformanceRating[WorkLifeBalance], 
    DimSatisfiedLevel[SatisfactionID])
)
```
Same calculations performed for Job, Environment and Relashionship Satisfaction, Manager and Self Ratings.

* Line charts to visualize metrics.

## Attrition

The last key insight I looked into was the attrition analysis. I created measures that calculate employee attrition based on Hire Date:
```
InactiveEmployeesDate = 
CALCULATE(
    [InactiveEmployees], 
    USERELATIONSHIP(DimEmployee[HireDate], 
    DimDate[Date])
)
```
```
% Attrition Rate Date = 
DIVIDE([InactiveEmployeesDate], [TotalEmployeesDate])
```

Additionally, I utilized column charts to visualize how various factors influence attrition:

I have compiled the report as a dashboard, with key findings detailed on page 2 of the project.
