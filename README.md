## About me
Hi all! I am a Data analyst with comprehensive experience in global recruitment and HR. Recently certified by Google in Data Analytics, I bring a good knowledge of SQL, MS Excel, Tableau, and Power BI. In addition, I'm actively enhancing my professional skills by studying R and Python. 

Here on GitHub, you'll find my Data Analytics portfolio and coding projects.
